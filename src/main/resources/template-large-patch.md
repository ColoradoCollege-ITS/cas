# What happened? 

This patch contains a very large number of commits or changed files and is quite impractical to evaluate and review. Please make sure your changes are broken down into smaller pull requests so that members can assist and review as quickly as possible. Furthermore, make sure your patch is based on the appropriate branch, starts off as a feature branch and targets the correct CAS branch here that is under active maintenance to avoid conflicts.

# How to contribute

Furthermore, before showing up with a large batch of files, changes with a brand new feature, you need to start a discussion with the community and project developers to see if they are OK with accepting, maintaining, and managing this change. Make sure the changes you have proposed fit the scope of the targeted CAS release policy. Unless your change is trivial and has been through proper review and is sponsored by a project maintainer, please do not spend time modifying code and configuration in a proposed pull request.

If you believe this to be an error, please post your explanation here as a comment and it will be reviewed as quickly as possible. For additional details, please review [the guidelines here](https://apereo.github.io/cas/developer/Contributor-Guidelines.html).
